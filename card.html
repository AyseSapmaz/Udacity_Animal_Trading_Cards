				<br>Differences between the sexes are slight and most apparent 
				when serpaes are ready to spawn. Males are more brightly 
				colored and slimmer, and  the dorsal fin is fully black. 
				In females, the dorsal fin is paler. 
				Females are also fuller in the body, even when not spawning.

				The deep red color of the serpae tetra adds to its popularity.
				The body of the serpae is flat and tall. A black  comma-shaped 
				spot is present just behind the gills. 
				<u><strong>The dorsal fin, edged with white, is predominantly black,
				and all other fins are red.</strong></u> The anal fin is edged in black 
				with a splash of white at the leading tip.
				These colors fade as the fish ages, particularly the spot behind the gills.  
				Females are plumper and  less brilliantly colored than their male counterparts. 
			    In captivity, long-finned variations have been produced.
